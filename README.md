# kmd — Knowledge MarkDown

Operate a markdown knowledge base (Obsidian-compatible, the
[LLM-wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f))
with your coding agent: disciplined writes, scheduled health checks, and
tool-level enforcement of the KB's invariants. Works with Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and every harness that reads the
[Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io).

The natural companion to [qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) (Query MarkDown):
**qmd queries your markdown; kmd keeps it** — ingested with provenance,
cross-referenced, contradiction-checked, and append-only where it matters.

Out of the box this is a **personal knowledge base** operator: you (and your
agent) ingest sources, grow interlinked pages, and keep the KB healthy.
Domain-specific behaviors — like running the KB inside an autonomous agent
organization — are opt-in [extensions](#extensions), not part of the core.

## What's inside

| Component | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Skills** | `kmd-ingest` | The write protocol — every KB write (new source, promoted artifact, learning, one-line fix) follows one checklist: classify → file raw material → dedup → condense → sweep → validate → log. Bundles `validate_page.py` + `kb_log.py`. |
| | `kmd-lint` | Health check — deterministic script (7 checks) + LLM judgment passes (contradictions, staleness, duplicates) + triage into direct fixes and open items. Bundles `lint_mechanical.py`. |
| **Agents** | `kmd-operator` | The KB interface: answers questions from the KB with citations, performs writes via kmd-ingest. Delegate any KB read/write to it. |
| | `kmd-librarian` | Hygiene: runs the full lint protocol, fixes mechanical issues, records judgment calls as actionable open items. |
| | `kmd-intake` | Drains the un-ingested sources queue: distills raw material you drop into `sources/` into pages. |
| **Hooks** | `kb_guard.py` (PreToolUse) | **Denies** hand-edits to the KB's `INDEX.md` (script-generated), `LOG.md` (append-only via script), `SCHEMA.md` modifications (owner-controlled), and edits to existing `sources/` files (append-only evidence; filing new sources stays allowed). |
| | `kb_post_write.py` (PostToolUse) | Validates every KB page write immediately — errors come back as blocking feedback; valid writes get a one-line reminder (sweep + log). |

The hooks are the enforcement tier of the protocol: skill + validation
scripts + lint remain the convention layer, hooks make the invariants hard.
Bash-level writes are deliberately not intercepted — lint is the backstop.

## Quick start (personal KB)

**Fastest path — the interactive installer.** Scaffolds the KB, initializes
git, installs the plugin into detected CLIs, and wires up qmd search, with
sensible defaults at every step:

```bash
npx create-kmd            # or point it at a dir / Obsidian vault
```

(Until the package is published to npm: `node installer/bin/create-kmd.mjs`
from a clone of this repo.)

**Manual paths** below, if you prefer to see every move.

**Option A — your own base folder** (any directory name works):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/notes/knowledge/sources
cp skills/kmd-ingest/references/schema-template.md ~/notes/knowledge/SCHEMA.md
printf '{"root": "knowledge"}\n' > ~/notes/.kmd.json   # optional if the dir is named kb/
```

**Option B — inside an Obsidian vault** (the KB is a folder in the vault;
the rest of the vault — daily notes, attachments — stays outside the
protocol, and `[[wikilinks]]` between the KB and the rest of the vault
resolve both ways):

```bash
VAULT=~/Obsidian/MyVault
mkdir -p "$VAULT/kb/sources"
cp skills/kmd-ingest/references/schema-template.md "$VAULT/kb/SCHEMA.md"
# no .kmd.json needed — kb/ is the default; add one only to rename the folder
```

`.obsidian/` and other dot-directories are ignored by validation, lint, and
link indexing. To treat the *entire* vault as the KB instead, place
`SCHEMA.md` at the vault root — a KB root is wherever that file lives. Do
that only if you want every note held to the page schema: in whole-vault
mode, daily notes and scratch files count as pages and lint will flag them.
The folder-in-vault layout is the right default.

Then install the plugin (see Install below) and, in a session:

```text
- drop raw material into <kb>/sources/
- "ingest the new sources"        -> kmd-intake / kmd-ingest take over
- "what do we know about X?"      -> kmd answers with citations
- "run a KB health check"         -> kmd-librarian runs kmd-lint
```

## KB discovery and configuration

Nothing is bound to a fixed path. A **KB root** is any directory containing
`SCHEMA.md` or `LOG.md`; scripts and hooks resolve it in this order:

1. explicit `--kb <path>`
2. `$KMD_ROOT`
3. walking up from cwd for a `.kmd.json`, a KB root, or a `kb/` child
   (the default layout)

Optional `.kmd.json` at the workspace root:

```json
{
  "root": "knowledge",        // KB dir relative to this file (default "kb")
  "report_dir": ".lint"       // lint reports, relative to the KB root
}
```

`INDEX.md` — the routing layer agents search before reading pages — is
generated by `recompile_index.py` (ships with the kmd-ingest skill; runs as
the last step of every ingest). It is script-owned: the guard hook denies
hand-edits, and lint flags a missing or stale index. Page filenames are
titles (Obsidian displays them everywhere), so pages use natural language —
`GPU memory math for LLMs.md`, not kebab slugs.

## Install — Claude Code

From the marketplace in this repo:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add yasik/kmd
claude plugin install kmd@kmd
```

Or for local development / trying it out:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir path/to/kmd
```

Skills appear as `/kmd:kmd-ingest` and `/kmd:kmd-lint`; agents
as `kmd:kmd-operator`, `kmd:kmd-librarian`,
`kmd:kmd-intake` (delegated automatically or @-mentioned).

## Install — OpenAI Codex

The manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` bundles the skills and the
PreToolUse guard hook:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add yasik/kmd   # or: add ./ from a local clone
```

Codex plugins cannot bundle agents yet — copy the TOML definitions:

```bash
cp codex/agents/*.toml ~/.codex/agents/      # personal
# or <repo>/.codex/agents/ for project scope
```

Codex caveats: the guard hook parses Codex
`apply_patch` payloads best-effort (`*** Update File:` / `*** Add File:`
markers); the PostToolUse validator is Claude-only for now; project hooks
require `.codex/` trust.

## Other harnesses — Cursor, Amp, opencode, pi, Hermes

The skills are the portable core: all major harnesses read the
[Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io), so kmd-ingest and kmd-lint
work everywhere. Enforcement hooks and bundled agents vary by harness:

| | Skills | Agents | Guard hook | qmd via MCP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cursor** | ✓ plugin / `.agents/skills/` | ✓ (bundled, same format) | ✓ bundled (`preToolUse`) | ✓ `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| **Amp** | ✓ `.agents/skills/` | ✗ (code-only subagents) | plugin adapter below | ✓ `amp.mcpServers` |
| **opencode** | ✓ `.agents/skills/` | ✓ `.opencode/agents/` (copy from `agents/`) | plugin adapter below, or `permission` config | ✓ `opencode.json` `mcp` |
| **pi** | ✓ `.agents/skills/` | ✗ (no subagents, by design) | extension adapter below | ✗ — agents call the `qmd` CLI directly |
| **Hermes** | ✓ `~/.hermes/skills/` | ✗ (delegation only) | ✓ shell hook (guard speaks its dialect) | ✓ `config.yaml` `mcp_servers` |

**Installing the skills.** The installer detects these harnesses and runs the
[`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI for you; manually:

```bash
npx skills add yasik/kmd --skill kmd-ingest --skill kmd-lint -a cursor -g
# -a values: cursor · amp · opencode · pi · hermes-agent
```

Cursor additionally loads the full plugin (skills + the three agents + the
guard hook) via its own manifest in this repo: install from the
[Cursor Marketplace] once published, or symlink the plugin directory into
`~/.cursor/plugins/local/kmd`. Hermes note: skills need `name`,
`description`, and `version` frontmatter — all present here.

**The guard hook per harness.** `kb_guard.py` reads the same stdin JSON
everywhere and answers in the caller's dialect (Claude/Codex
`hookSpecificOutput`, Cursor `permission: deny`, Hermes `decision: block`).

- *Hermes* — `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  hooks:
    pre_tool_call:
      - command: "python3 <plugin>/hooks/scripts/kb_guard.py"
  ```

- *opencode* — no config-file hook needed for basics: `permission` rules can
  deny edits by path pattern. For the full guard, a plugin adapter
  (untested; `.opencode/plugins/kb-guard.js`):

  ```js
  export default async ({ $ }) => ({
    "tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => {
      const payload = JSON.stringify({ tool_name: input.tool, tool_input: output.args });
      const res = await $`python3 <plugin>/hooks/scripts/kb_guard.py < ${new Response(payload)}`.text();
      const verdict = res.trim() && JSON.parse(res);
      if (verdict?.hookSpecificOutput?.permissionDecision === "deny")
        throw new Error(verdict.hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason);
    },
  });
  ```

- *Amp* — same shape via a TypeScript plugin's `tool.call` event returning
  `{ action: "reject-and-continue", message }` (untested adapter; see
  ampcode.com/manual/plugin-api).
- *pi* — a `~/.pi/agent/extensions/kb-guard.ts` extension on the `tool_call`
  event returning `{ block: true, reason }` (untested adapter; see pi's
  extensions.md).

Where no adapter is installed, the protocol still holds — validation scripts
and lint remain the backstop, exactly as designed.

## Search — wiring up qmd

The protocol's dedup gate and query routing assume the KB is searchable.
Everything works without a search backend — agents fall back to `INDEX.md` +
grep — but real retrieval quality comes from
[qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd): local-first hybrid search (BM25 +
vectors + reranking, fully on-device) whose MCP server gives agents
`query` / `get` / `multi_get` / `status` tools.

**Automatic** — `npx create-kmd` (the Quick start installer) does
all of the below interactively.

**Manual** — five commands:

```bash
npm install -g @tobilu/qmd                  # or: bun install -g @tobilu/qmd

qmd collection add <kb-root> --name mykb    # index the KB
qmd context add qmd://mykb "Knowledge base: entities, concepts, projects, decisions, reports, and raw sources"
qmd update                                  # build the BM25 index (fast, no models)
qmd embed                                   # optional: semantic search — downloads ~2GB of local models

claude mcp add --scope user qmd -- qmd mcp  # expose the tools to Claude Code
```

Codex — add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.qmd]
command = "qmd"
args = ["mcp"]
```

How the pieces get used: `qmd search` (BM25-only, instant) covers the
ingest dedup gate and quick lookups; `qmd query` (hybrid + rerank) is for
judgment-heavy retrieval; `get`/`multi_get` do bounded line-range reads.
The context line matters — qmd feeds it to the reranker. Keep the index
fresh alongside the hygiene jobs below: `qmd update && qmd embed`.

## Orchestration — running the KB on a schedule

The KB stays healthy because hygiene is *scheduled*, not remembered. A
sensible default cadence:

| Job | Agent | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Drain new sources into pages | `kmd-intake` | daily, or after you drop material |
| Full health check + report | `kmd-librarian` | weekly |
| Reindex search | `qmd update && qmd embed` | with each of the above |
| Recompile `INDEX.md` | `recompile_index.py` (kmd-ingest) | with each of the above |

**Claude Code — native scheduling.** Use `/schedule` in a session to create a
recurring routine (a cloud agent on a cron schedule), e.g. *"every Monday at
8am, run a full KB lint pass on ~/notes as the kmd-librarian agent and leave
the report in the KB"*.

**Claude Code — system cron (local, headless).** `claude -p` runs a prompt
non-interactively with your installed plugins; give it edit permissions and
point it at the workspace:

```cron
# daily intake at 07:30
30 7 * * * cd ~/notes && claude -p "Use the kmd:kmd-intake agent to drain un-ingested sources from the KB" --permission-mode acceptEdits

# weekly librarian pass, Monday 08:00
0 8 * * 1 cd ~/notes && claude -p "Use the kmd:kmd-librarian agent to run a full KB lint pass" --permission-mode acceptEdits
```

**Codex — system cron.** `codex exec` is the headless equivalent; reference
the skill explicitly and grant workspace writes:

```cron
0 8 * * 1 cd ~/notes && codex exec --full-auto "Run the kmd-lint skill end to end on this workspace's KB as author 'librarian'"
```

Two notes that matter in practice: the enforcement hooks are active in these
scheduled sessions too (the plugin travels with the CLI), and every scheduled
run still ends with a `LOG.md` entry — so `LOG.md` doubles as your audit
trail of what automation did while you weren't looking.

## Extensions

The core above is domain-agnostic knowledge management. Extensions layer
domain-specific conventions on top — declared in `.kmd.json`, loaded by the
skills only when present, invisible otherwise. One ships today.

### Org extension — KBs inside agent organizations

For a KB shared by an autonomous agent organization (an org chart of agents
with roles, workspaces, and handoffs). Enable it by declaring `"org"` in
`.kmd.json`:

```json
{
  "root": "kb",
  "org": {
    "charter": "_charter",    // where ORG.md (roles/ownership) lives
    "agents": "agents"        // agent workspaces (inboxes) root
  }
}
```

What it changes — defined in `references/org-extension.md` inside each skill:

- `author:` and `--agent` become **agent ids**; the author field doubles as
  a routing address
- `kmd-intake` checks **topical ownership** in `ORG.md` and hands off
  out-of-domain sources to the owner's inbox instead of ingesting them
- `kmd-librarian` **routes** judgment findings to page authors' inboxes
  rather than recording open items for a single owner
- provenance may cite agent-workspace files (daily logs, handoff notes)

The ingest discipline itself is identical in both modes — the extension
changes routing, never the protocol.

## Requirements

Python 3.12+ on PATH as `python3` (per this repo's
[code style](../../docs/code-style/python/README.md); the scripts use only
the standard library — no packages to install). Source immutability checks
need the KB under git (skipped gracefully otherwise). One bootstrap edge: a
brand-new KB with a custom directory name has no markers until `SCHEMA.md`
exists, so hook protection starts after the schema is bootstrapped (or
immediately, with a `.kmd.json`).
